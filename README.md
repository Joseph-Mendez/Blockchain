# Blockchain

This is a Blockchain I built with JavaScript that utilizes API access and a User-Interface.

Includes:
A proof of work algorithm to secure the network.
Hashing algorithms to secure the data within the blockchain.
The ability to mine new blocks that contain data.
The ability to create transactions and store them in blocks.
An API/server that will be used to interact with the blockchain from the internet.
A consensus algorithm to verify that the network nodes have valid data and are synchronized.
A broadcasting system to keep the data in the blockchain network synchronized.
